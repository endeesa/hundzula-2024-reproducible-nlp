Create a well-commented Jupyter notebook based on the following  python code: \n\n\n
```python
# 1. Summary
# [Text cell explaining the dataset and objective]

# 2. Setup
#!pip install comet-ml


import os
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# This must be imported before any other ML library to enable automatic experiment tracking
from comet_ml import Experiment


from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Initialize Comet ML
experiment = Experiment(api_key=os.environ["COMET_API_KEY"],   # Create a FREE Comet ML account and get your API key here: https://www.comet.com/signup
                        project_name="hundzula_sms_spam_classification_demo")

# 3. Data Loading and Preprocessing
path = 'data/raw/sms_spam_collection.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(path)

# Basic data exploration
df.head()
df.info()
df.describe()

# Preprocess the data (text cleaning, tokenization)
def preprocess_text(text):
    # [Add text preprocessing steps here]
    return processed_text

df['processed_text'] = df['text'].apply(preprocess_text)

# 4. Feature Extraction
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer()
X = vectorizer.fit_transform(df['processed_text'])
y = df['label']

# Split the dataset
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2)

# 5. Model Building
model = LogisticRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Log model parameters and training process
experiment.log_parameters(model.get_params())

# 6. Model Evaluation
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
# [Calculate metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score]
experiment.log_metric("accuracy", accuracy)
# [Log other metrics]

# 7. Results Visualization
# [Code to plot confusion matrix and classification report]

# 8. Conclusion
# [Text cell summarizing the findings and benefits of using Comet ML and highlight usage with DL or LLM frameworks]
```

Keep in mind that the notebook, must illustrate a simple way to get started with experiment tracking using Comet ML. You can use the provided code as a starting point and add more details, explanations, and visualizations as needed. The dataset used comes from Kaggle:
